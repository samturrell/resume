Hello 👋, you've landed on Sam Turrell's resume. I am a highly skilled Senior web developer based in York, United Kingdom. Experienced in all aspect of frontend development, ranging from pixel perfect HTML/CSS reproduction all the way to bespoke enterprise scale javascript-intensive interfaces. 

I am self taught and commercially-proven in building scalable and high quality systems. With a trained eye for detail, well documented code and a passion for performant web, I am able to deliver exactly what the project brief requires, and then some.

Although focused on frontend development, I also have fairly extensive backend experience using PHP frameworks such as Laravel.

## 👏 Experience

### Lead Frontend Engineer (2023 - present)

As a Tech Lead at hedgehog lab I steer the technical direction of the frontend department to ensure we stay at the cutting edge, and ensuring we deliver high quality maintainable code for our clients.

### Lead Frontend Developer (2013 - 2023)

#### Netsells Ltd - York, UK

Heading up the frontend development side of the company it is my responsibility to develop performant, scalable systems within client budget and to investigate new technology and tools to increase both efficiency and quality.

### 🍻 Open Source

#### Sweetalert2

Sweetalert2 is a JavaScript library for modals and dialogs on the web, which achieves 200k+ downloads per day. My first major contribution to the package was to implement a build process for more efficient bundling for different module types. Since then I have implemented numerous bug fixes for issues found by the community, optional CSS injection and I am currently working on a complete form-building API for generating dynamic forms.

#### Laroute

Laroute is a Laravel package for providing routes defined in a Laravel application to a JavaScript frontend in an attempt to avoid hard-coding API endpoints in your scripts. This package is a more supported fork of a project by `axn` which in itself is a fork of the abandoned laroute package by `aaronlord`. My changes reduce a lot of code bloat and minor additions to how the routes are matched. This package is available on the packagist registry.

#### Vue Packages

I am a big fan of the Vue ecosystem and have built numerous packages, including:

- [vue-laroute](https://github.com/samturrell/vue-laroute) - a wrapper package for injecting your Laravel routes into your Vue.js application using the laroute package
- [vue-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/samturrell/vue-breadcrumbs) - a breadcrumb package which utilises nested routes when using vue-router
- [vue-match-heights](https://github.com/samturrell/vue-match-heights) - a simple package for aligning element so that they are the same height
- [vue-stripe-payment](https://github.com/samturrell/vue-stripe-payment) - a wrapper package for the Stripe.js jquery.payment library
